## What Is Paper Trading?

[[Lexicon#paper trading|Paper trading]] refers to simulated trading – practicing buying and selling financial instruments without using real money. In a paper trading account (also called a **trading simulator** or demo account), you make trades with *virtual* funds, so there’s no real monetary risk[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim). This concept dates back to when learners would jot down imaginary trades on paper, but today it’s done through sophisticated online platforms that mimic real market conditions[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=The%20term%20,Paper%20trading%20at%20Schwab). In essence, paper trading lets you **practice investing in real-time markets with zero risk**, since only “imaginary” money is at stake[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim).

## Why Practice with a Trading Simulator?

Using a trading simulator offers several benefits for new and experienced investors alike:

- **No Financial Risk:** You can’t lose real money. This allows you to test strategies and learn from mistakes without fear of financial loss[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=I%27ve%20found%20the%20most%20effective,without%20the%20threat%20of%20losses)[investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/072915/pros-and-cons-paper-trading.asp#:~:text=No%20Risk). For a first-time trader, dipping your toes in with paper trades helps build confidence without the “threat of losses” hanging over you[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=I%27ve%20found%20the%20most%20effective,without%20the%20threat%20of%20losses).
- **Real Market Conditions:** Quality simulators use live or near-live market data, so you can see how the markets are changing and how your investments would perform in actual conditions[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim). You get to observe real price movements, volatility, and news impacts in real time, but in a sandbox environment.
- **Skill Development:** It’s a chance to refine your trading skills and test new strategies. You can try out different trade types or complex orders and see the outcomes. Treating the practice as if it were real – doing research, setting entry/exit points, and monitoring positions – helps you develop good habits[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=,improve%20your%20craft%20is%20by). Any flaws in your strategy or understanding will show up in the results, which you can then study and learn from.
- **Emotional Prep:** Trading real money can trigger emotions like fear and greed that affect decision-making. While a simulator can’t fully reproduce the psychological pressure of real gains or losses, it lets you get a feel for following a plan without those pressures[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=That%20said%2C%20be%20mindful%20of,gain%20experience%20without%20the%20risk). As you gain experience in the simulator, you’ll hopefully be better prepared to manage reactions when you eventually trade live.

*(Tip: To get the most out of paper trading, approach it seriously. Use the same amount of money and types of trades you would in real life and keep a log of your trades and thought processes. This way, you build realistic experience and avoid developing bad habits in the “play” environment[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=,improve%20your%20craft%20is%20by).)*

## Platforms and Tools for Simulated Trading

**Good news:** Many brokers and online platforms offer paper trading tools to let you simulate real investments. These trading simulators provide virtual cash and real market feeds so you can practice in a realistic setting[investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/072915/pros-and-cons-paper-trading.asp#:~:text=Trade%20simulators%20offer%20the%20most,once%20the%20student%20is%20ready). Some popular options include:

- **thinkorswim’s paperMoney (Charles Schwab):** Originally from TD Ameritrade (now part of Schwab), thinkorswim’s “paperMoney” mode is a highly regarded simulator. It comes funded with $100,000 in virtual money by default [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/072915/pros-and-cons-paper-trading.asp#:~:text=,a%20%241%20million%20opening%20balance), allowing you to trade stocks, ETFs, options, futures, or forex in real market conditions without risking a dime [schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=Practice%20trading%20with%20%24100%2C000%20of,virtual%20buying%20power). We’ll dive deeper into thinkorswim below, as it’s a tool you’re interested in.
- **Webull Paper Trading:** Webull offers unlimited paper trades on its platform [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/072915/pros-and-cons-paper-trading.asp#:~:text=,a%20%241%20million%20opening%20balance). Like thinkorswim, it provides real-time quotes and a configurable virtual account for practice.
- **Interactive Brokers Demo:** Interactive Brokers provides a paper trading account (with $1,000,000 virtual balance) for clients to practice on their Trader Workstation platform[investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/072915/pros-and-cons-paper-trading.asp#:~:text=,a%20%241%20million%20opening%20balance).

There are also free stock market game websites and apps (like Investopedia’s simulator or TradingView’s paper trading mode) that let you practice trading with live or delayed market data. The key is that all these tools let you watch how the market moves and **simulate trades in response to those movements**, so you can learn by doing without financial risk.

## The Thinkorswim Platform (Now Powered by Schwab)

Thinkorswim is an advanced trading platform well-known among active traders for its powerful features. It was originally developed by TD Ameritrade, but after Charles Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade, the **thinkorswim platform has been retained and integrated into Schwab’s offerings** [schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/welcome-to-schwab#:~:text=TD%20Ameritrade%2C%20Inc,wealth%20management%20and%20investing%20solutions). In fact, Schwab explicitly touts that clients get access to the **thinkorswim suite of platforms** (desktop, web, and mobile) along with robust trading education resources[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/welcome-to-schwab#:~:text=TD%20Ameritrade%2C%20Inc,wealth%20management%20and%20investing%20solutions).

**Key features of thinkorswim:**

- **Multiple Platform Versions:** You can use thinkorswim as a downloadable desktop application, a web-based platform, or a mobile app, with each offering a rich set of trading tools [schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Get%20ready%20to%20trade%20with,or%20preferred%20way%20to%20trade)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=thinkorswim%20web). All versions are professional-grade and sync with your account.
- **Real-Time Data and Analysis Tools:** thinkorswim provides streaming real-time quotes and charts, plus an array of technical analysis tools, indicators, and drawing features to deep-dive into market trends [schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Robust%20charting%20and%20analysis). You can analyze stocks, options, futures, and forex with professional-level charting (e.g. multiple charts at once, technical studies, etc.).
- **Broad Product Access:** The platform allows trading of **stocks, ETFs, options, futures, and forex** – pretty much any major asset class – all from one interface [schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Broad%20range%20of%20products). For example, you could practice trading stock shares one day and test an options strategy the next, all within the same platform.
- **Advanced Order Types and Tools:** As an advanced platform, thinkorswim lets you experiment with complex order types (multi-leg options, conditional orders) and features like stock scanners and watchlists. Don’t worry if these are beyond your current vocabulary – you can start simple – but it’s good to know the capability is there as you grow.
- **Integration of Education:** A big plus for learners is the **built-in educational content**. Thinkorswim has a Learning Center with on-demand education, live news, expert commentary, and even “chat rooms” where traders discuss ideas[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Built)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=%2A%20Built,platform%20chat%20rooms). This means you can learn about trading strategies or terminology right on the platform, without having to leave or search elsewhere. Schwab has expanded its library of resources for traders, so you have **“more trading education than ever before”** at your fingertips[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Award).

Overall, thinkorswim is considered a **“world-class” trading platform**, and Schwab is not only keeping it but continuing to invest in it[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/147wgtx/psa_schwab_transition_details/#:~:text=PSA%3A%20Schwab%20Transition%20Details%20%3A,but%20is%20investing%20to)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/welcome-to-schwab#:~:text=TD%20Ameritrade%2C%20Inc,wealth%20management%20and%20investing%20solutions). Even if it can feel overwhelming at first (given its many features), it’s worth getting familiar with, since it can serve all your needs as your skills grow. Importantly for you, it includes the **paperMoney** simulator mode for risk-free practice.

## Using thinkorswim’s paperMoney Simulator

One of thinkorswim’s greatest advantages for learners is its **paperMoney®** feature – this is the paper trading mode. It is **built into all versions** of thinkorswim, so whether you’re on the desktop software, web browser, or mobile app, you can switch to the simulated trading environment easily[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Built%20in%20to%20all%20thinkorswim,many%20thinkorswim%20tools%20and%20features). Here’s what you need to know about paperMoney on thinkorswim:

- **Real-Time Market Data:** paperMoney lets you practice trading with **real market quotes and price movements**, just like a live account[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim). You’ll see the same stock prices, charts, and fluctuations as everyone else in the market, which helps you learn how to react to market changes in real time.
- **Virtual Funds:** When you use paperMoney, the platform will start you off with a virtual cash balance (generally $100,000 by default) to trade with[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=Practice%20trading%20with%20%24100%2C000%20of,virtual%20buying%20power). This play money can be used to buy or sell stocks, options, etc., and you can adjust the amount or reset it if needed. *For example, TD Ameritrade’s standard paperMoney setup (now under Schwab) gives $100k in a virtual margin account and another $100k in a virtual IRA account by default[newtrading.io](https://www.newtrading.io/thinkorswim-paper-trading/#:~:text=Once%20your%20Guest%20Pass%20with,of%20access%20to%20the%20platform).* This generous balance lets you simulate everything from small trades to larger strategies.
- **All Major Products Available:** You can trade **equities, options, futures, and forex** in the simulator just as you would in real life[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=Practice%20trading%20with%20%24100%2C000%20of,virtual%20buying%20power). The simulator supports nearly all the order types and instruments that the live platform does. Want to try buying 10 shares of Apple? Practicing an options spread on the S&P 500? It’s all available in paperMoney. This breadth is useful for exploring different markets as you learn.
- **Same Tools and Interface:** Crucially, paperMoney **mirrors the live thinkorswim platform’s interface and features**[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim). The charts, watchlists, scanner, technical studies, news feeds, and other tools are all there in simulation mode. This means as you practice, you’re also learning how to use the thinkorswim software itself. By the time you transition to real trading, you’ll know how to navigate the platform, place orders, set up charts, etc. (no scrambling to learn the interface when real money is on the line!). In fact, Schwab highlights that simulated trading is great for getting comfortable with a new platform’s functions so you’re not **“scrambling to navigate a new tool when you’re in the thick of the action.”**[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=4,new%20platform)
- **Visual Cues for Sim vs. Live:** Thinkorswim provides visual reminders so you always know if you’re trading fake or real money. For instance, on the desktop version your window borders are **orange in paperMoney mode and blue in live mode**[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=application%20before%20risking%20real%20money). This helps prevent any confusion. You can toggle between *Live Trading* and *paperMoney* modes at login or within the platform, but they remain separate – actions in your paper account won’t affect your real account (and vice versa)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=application%20before%20risking%20real%20money).
- **Reset and Replay:** Don’t worry about making mistakes in paperMoney – that’s what it’s for! If a practice trade goes wrong, you can analyze what happened with no consequence to your wallet. The platform even allows you to reset your paper account’s balance and clear positions if you want a fresh start[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=won%27t%20port%20over%20to%20the,other). Some traders periodically reset their paper accounts to keep the experience realistic (after all, in real life you can’t “magic” your losses away, but resetting can be useful after a learning phase or testing a particularly experimental strategy).

Using paperMoney, you’ll be able to **see how the market changes and how your portfolio would react**, all in real time. For example, if news breaks and stocks start moving fast, you can experience that volatility in the simulator and practice making decisions – a valuable learning experience. The combination of real-world data and zero risk is what makes paper trading so powerful for education.

## Getting Started with thinkorswim (paperMoney)

Now to the practical question: *How do you actually start using thinkorswim and its paper trading feature?* You have a couple of paths to access it, depending on whether you’re ready to open a brokerage account or not:

- **Option 1: Open a Schwab Account (Permanent Access)** – Since thinkorswim is now under Charles Schwab, any Schwab client can use thinkorswim and paperMoney for free. If you don’t already have an account, you can **open a Schwab brokerage account** online (with no account minimums or fees to open). Once you have login credentials, you simply download the thinkorswim platform (or use the web version) and log in with your Schwab ID. You’ll have the choice to toggle into *paperMoney* mode at the login screen or within the app[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=application%20before%20risking%20real%20money). From there, you’ll see your virtual $100k and can start simulated trading immediately. Being a full client also gives you unlimited time to use paperMoney whenever you want – there’s no expiration. *(If you were previously a TD Ameritrade client with thinkorswim, note that those accounts have moved to Schwab, but you **still have access to the thinkorswim platform suite** with your new Schwab login[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/welcome-to-schwab#:~:text=What%20platforms%20do%20I%20have,account%20has%20moved%20to%20Schwab).)*
- **Option 2: Use Schwab’s thinkorswim “Guest Pass” (30-Day Trial)** – If you’re not ready to open a full account yet, **Schwab offers a free 30-day Guest Pass** to try out thinkorswim without any account or funding requirement[pressroom.aboutschwab.com](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2024/Schwab-Launches-thinkorswim-Guest-Pass-Offering-a-30-Day-Test-Drive-of-Its-Award-Winning-Trading-Platforms/default.aspx#:~:text=WESTLAKE%2C%20Texas,com%20and%20Schwab%20Mobile). This is perfect for test-driving the platform. To sign up, visit Schwab’s Guest Pass page (at **schwab.com/guestpass**) and fill out the short form with your email[pressroom.aboutschwab.com](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2024/Schwab-Launches-thinkorswim-Guest-Pass-Offering-a-30-Day-Test-Drive-of-Its-Award-Winning-Trading-Platforms/default.aspx#:~:text=WESTLAKE%2C%20Texas,com%20and%20Schwab%20Mobile)[newtrading.io](https://www.newtrading.io/thinkorswim-paper-trading/#:~:text=How%20to%20Sign%20Up%20for,Thinkorswim%E2%80%99s%20Paper%20Trading%20Simulator). Once you register, you’ll get access to all three thinkorswim platforms (desktop, web, mobile) in paperMoney mode for 30 days[pressroom.aboutschwab.com](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2024/Schwab-Launches-thinkorswim-Guest-Pass-Offering-a-30-Day-Test-Drive-of-Its-Award-Winning-Trading-Platforms/default.aspx#:~:text=thinkorswim%20trading%20platform%20suite%20without,com%20and%20Schwab%20Mobile). The Guest Pass gives you the same $100,000 virtual buying power and access to all the tools and asset classes (stocks, options, futures, etc.) in the simulated environment[pressroom.aboutschwab.com](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2024/Schwab-Launches-thinkorswim-Guest-Pass-Offering-a-30-Day-Test-Drive-of-Its-Award-Winning-Trading-Platforms/default.aspx#:~:text=thinkorswim%20Guest%20Pass%20allows%20traders,trading%2C%20analysis%2C%20and%20charting%20tools). In other words, it’s the full thinkorswim experience, just time-limited. This is a great way to start if you simply want to *see how it all works* before committing to an account. During the 30 days, you can practice freely and explore the features. (If you find the platform useful, you can then transition to a permanent account to continue using it after the trial).

Whether via an account or Guest Pass, the **starting point** is to get the thinkorswim platform itself: you can download the desktop software from Schwab’s website or use the thinkorswim Web version immediately through your browser (no install needed)[newtrading.io](https://www.newtrading.io/thinkorswim-paper-trading/#:~:text=Noteworthy). Many beginners find the web version a bit more streamlined to start with, while the desktop version offers the full range of features and customization as you become more advanced[newtrading.io](https://www.newtrading.io/thinkorswim-paper-trading/#:~:text=Noteworthy). Feel free to use whichever you’re comfortable with – both have the paperMoney capability. Once logged in, make sure you **switch to paperMoney mode** (look for an option or toggle usually at the login screen or a dropdown after login; on desktop it’s a toggle at the login box). The interface will indicate you’re in the virtual account. From there, you can **simulate trades just as you would for real**: search for a stock or ticker symbol, bring up its quote or chart, and place a buy or sell order to see how it would execute. Don’t hesitate to try things out – add indicators to charts, create a watchlist of companies you know, or practice entering different order types. It’s all reversible in the sandbox, so explore and learn by doing.

As you use paperMoney, remember to pay attention to the results of your trades. Utilize the platform’s tracking tools – for instance, the *Monitor* tab on thinkorswim will show your positions, profit/loss, and account balance changes even in paper mode[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=losses%20may%20be%20traced%20back,or%20method%20with%20real%20money). Reviewing these can help you understand what went right or wrong. It’s a good idea to treat it like a real portfolio: if you don’t understand something (say, why an option trade lost money, or what a certain metric means), make a note of it. This brings us to the next point: learning resources and vocabulary.

## Learning Resources and Building Your Trading Vocabulary

Since you mentioned you’re still learning a lot of trading vocabulary, it’s important to leverage educational resources and take an active approach to build your understanding. The combination of *paper trading plus education* is a powerful way to ramp up your knowledge. Here are some tips and resources:

- **Charles Schwab’s Educational Content:** Schwab (bolstered by the integration of TD Ameritrade’s offerings) provides **extensive education for traders** – and much of it is free. You can access articles, webinars, and tutorials through the **“Learning Center”** and Schwab’s website. In fact, Schwab touts an “expanding library of resources tailored to traders”[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Award). For example, they offer **thinkorswim demos and tutorials** (on the Schwab site and YouTube) that can walk you through using the platform and understanding trading concepts. You might check out **Schwab’s “Trading Insights & Education”** section, where you’ll find beginner guides on stocks, options, technical analysis, etc., as well as videos. One reference you might find useful is Schwab’s own tutorial on using paperMoney[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/4-reasons-to-try-paper-trading#:~:text=2,new%20strategy) – it suggests practical scenarios to try. Utilizing these official resources can help demystify terms (like *“margin,” “limit order,” “volatility”*, etc.) in context. And because they are integrated into the thinkorswim platform (e.g. via the **Education tab or Learning Center inside the software[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Built)**), you can often read about a concept and then immediately switch to your paper trade to try it out. This hands-on reinforcement is great for learning.
- **Investopedia and Glossaries:** For quick definitions of unfamiliar terminology, **Investopedia** is an excellent online dictionary for financial terms. If you come across a word or concept you don’t understand (say, “P/E ratio” or “stop loss”), looking it up on Investopedia can give you a clear explanation. Schwab’s site itself also has glossaries and explainers in their education section. Don’t hesitate to pause and research a term – understanding the language of investing is crucial. Over time, terms like *bullish, bearish, spreads, ETFs, earnings, etc.* will become part of your vocabulary. Keep a notebook or digital document where you **track new terms** you encounter. Write down a simple definition in your own words and maybe an example – reviewing these notes periodically will reinforce your learning.
- **Structured Courses or Tutorials:** If you prefer a more structured learning path, consider going through a beginner trading course or a series of tutorials. TD Ameritrade (now Schwab) historically had a well-regarded **“Trading Essentials”** course and similar materials for clients. Check if those are accessible through your Schwab account or the Schwab website. There are also many books and online courses for novice investors that cover everything from basic concepts (like what is a stock or bond) to reading charts and financial statements. Pairing such coursework with your paper trading can accelerate your progress. For instance, you could read a lesson about “technical analysis indicators” and then experiment with those indicators on thinkorswim’s charts using paperMoney.
- **Community and Forums:** Sometimes discussing with others can help make things clearer. Thinkorswim has in-platform chat rooms where traders talk strategy (you can observe these to pick up insights or ask questions once you feel comfortable)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=%2A%20Built,platform%20chat%20rooms). Outside of that, communities like the r/thinkorswim subreddit or other trading forums might be useful **for specific platform tips** or beginner questions – just remember to be critical and careful with any “advice” from strangers. Use community input to learn the platform or general tips, but **rely on reputable sources for factual learning**.
- **Practice and Reflection:** Finally, **learning by doing** is one of the best ways to solidify vocabulary and concepts. Every time you place a paper trade, make a note of why you did it (“I bought 10 shares of X because I think their earnings report next week will be good,” for example). Afterward, review what happened – did the trade go as expected? If not, what term or concept might explain the outcome (maybe “volatility” spiked or the stock moved with the overall market)? This reflective practice will naturally lead you to learn more. If you find gaps in your knowledge during these reviews, that’s your cue to look up those concepts in the educational resources mentioned above. Over time, terms that once felt like jargon will start making sense as you see them in action.

## Conclusion

Starting your investing journey with **paper trading is a wise and safe approach**. It **allows you to simulate real investments without any monetary risk**, so you can build skills and confidence[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim). Tools like **thinkorswim’s paperMoney®** provide an authentic market experience – you’ll see real-time market changes, use professional-grade trading tools, and learn how to navigate a top-tier platform, all while your real money stays safely on the sidelines[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=paperMoney%C2%AE%20is%20the%20virtual%20trading,during%20live%20trading%20within%20thinkorswim)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/paper-trading#:~:text=Practice%20trading%20with%20%24100%2C000%20of,virtual%20buying%20power). Charles Schwab’s decision to keep and support the thinkorswim platform means you have access to an “award-winning” trading environment and a wealth of educational content to go with it[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/welcome-to-schwab#:~:text=TD%20Ameritrade%2C%20Inc,wealth%20management%20and%20investing%20solutions)[schwab.com](https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim#:~:text=Award).

By taking advantage of the **paperMoney simulator**, you can **practice trading strategies, track how your ideas perform, and gradually familiarize yourself with market terminology and dynamics**. Remember to make use of the abundant resources at your disposal – from Schwab’s trading education materials to Investopedia and other guides – to strengthen your understanding of each new concept you encounter. Over time, you’ll grow more comfortable with the language of investing and the mechanics of trading.
